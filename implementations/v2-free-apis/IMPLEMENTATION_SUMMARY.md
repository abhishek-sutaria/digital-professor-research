## 🎯 How It Works

### Configuration Flow:

```
.env file
   ↓
AVATAR_SYSTEM_PROMPT variable
   ↓
gemini_service.py (loads on startup)
   ↓
Every user question uses this persona
   ↓
Consistent character in all responses
```

### Technical Implementation:

**Before:**
```python
# Hardcoded in gemini_service.py
system_context = """You are a friendly, knowledgeable AI avatar assistant..."""
```

**After:**
```python
# Loaded from environment variable
self.system_prompt = os.getenv('AVATAR_SYSTEM_PROMPT')

# With fallback
if not self.system_prompt:
    self.system_prompt = """Default friendly assistant..."""
```

## 📝 Example Interactions

### Question: "How should we approach our marketing strategy?"

**Expected Jenniel Response Style:**
> "Let's start with strategy first. Do we really understand why customers choose us? I recommend a three-step framework: 1) Audit your current marketing capabilities, 2) Align them to customer value creation, and 3) Measure what matters - not vanity metrics."

**Key Elements:**
- ✅ Starts with strategic question
- ✅ Presents framework
- ✅ Focuses on customer value
- ✅ Evidence-based approach
- ✅ Numbered steps

### Question: "Should we chase market share aggressively?"

**Expected Jenniel Response Style:**
> "Market share without profit logic rarely creates sustainable value. Instead, focus on building differentiated capabilities that drive customer choice and firm profitability. What evidence do we have that share gains will align with our strategic advantages?"

**Key Elements:**
- ✅ Questions the premise (consultative style)
- ✅ Links to value creation
- ✅ Avoids blindly chasing trends
- ✅ Evidence-focused
- ✅ Strategic fit emphasis
