# Voice Input Feature Guide

## Overview
Your AI Avatar now supports **press-and-hold voice input** using the Web Speech API! Users can now interact with Professor Jenniel using their voice instead of typing.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Press and hold** the green microphone button üé§
2. **Speak** your question while holding the button
3. **Release** the button when done speaking
4. The speech is automatically converted to text
5. The question is sent to Professor Jenniel
6. You receive a video response from the avatar

### Visual Feedback
- **Green microphone button**: Ready to record
- **Red pulsing button**: Currently recording
- **Recording indicator**: Shows "üé§ Listening... (Release to send)" banner while recording
- **Text input field**: Displays the recognized speech in real-time

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Chrome/Edge**: Full support (recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Safari**: Limited support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Firefox**: Limited support
- ‚ùå **Older browsers**: Falls back to text-only input

The microphone button automatically disables on unsupported browsers with a helpful message.

### Features Implemented
1. **Press-and-hold recording**: Natural interaction like voice messaging apps
2. **Real-time transcription**: See your words appear as you speak
3. **Auto-submit**: Automatically sends the message when you release the button
4. **Mobile support**: Works with both touch and mouse events
5. **Error handling**: 
   - Microphone permission denied
   - No speech detected
   - Browser compatibility check
6. **Graceful degradation**: Text input always available as fallback

### Architecture
- **Frontend only**: Uses browser's built-in Web Speech API
- **No backend changes**: Reuses existing `/api/chat` endpoint
- **No additional API keys**: Completely free (uses Google's speech recognition via Chrome)

## Testing the Feature

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
1. Open http://localhost:8000
2. Click and hold the green üé§ button
3. Speak clearly: "What is marketing strategy?"
4. Release the button
5. Watch Professor Jenniel respond with a video!

### Mobile
1. Open http://localhost:8000 on your phone
2. Tap and hold the microphone button
3. Speak your question
4. Release your finger
5. Get your video response!

### Sample Voice Queries
Try asking:
- "What are marketing capabilities?"
- "How do I align my marketing organization?"
- "What metrics should I track for customer satisfaction?"
- "How do I create a customer-centric culture?"

## Files Modified
1. **frontend/index.html**: Added microphone button and recording indicator UI
2. **frontend/style.css**: Styled mic button with recording animations
3. **frontend/script.js**: Implemented Web Speech API with press-and-hold logic

## Code Architecture

### Key Components
```javascript
// Speech Recognition Setup
- initializeSpeechRecognition(): Initialize Web Speech API
- setupMicrophoneButton(): Set up event listeners
- startRecording(): Begin voice capture
- stopRecording(): End capture and trigger auto-send

// Event Handlers
- mousedown/mouseup: Desktop support
- touchstart/touchend: Mobile support
- recognition.onresult: Handle speech-to-text
- recognition.onend: Auto-submit message
- recognition.onerror: Handle errors gracefully
```

### Visual States
```css
.mic-btn - Green (ready)
.mic-btn.recording - Red + pulse animation (recording)
.recording-indicator - Animated banner when recording
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Microphone access denied"
- Click the üîí icon in browser address bar
- Allow microphone access for localhost
- Refresh the page

### "Voice input not supported"
- Use Chrome or Edge browser
- Update to the latest browser version
- Fallback: Use text input instead

### "No speech detected"
- Speak closer to the microphone
- Check system microphone settings
- Ensure microphone is not muted
- Try again with clearer speech

### Button doesn't respond
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add language selection for non-English speakers
- Show confidence scores for recognized speech
- Add voice activity detection visualization
- Support continuous conversation mode
- Add voice commands for app control

## Privacy & Security
- All speech recognition happens via browser's API
- Audio is NOT stored on your server
- Chrome sends audio to Google's speech service
- No recordings are saved locally
- Text is only sent to Gemini API (existing flow)
