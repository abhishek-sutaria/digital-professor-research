# 🎓 Digital Professor Research

> **Research Progress Repository** - Exploring AI-powered educational avatars through multiple implementation approaches

## 🎯 Research Goal

This repository documents my research journey in developing a **Digital Professor** - an AI-powered avatar system that can deliver personalized educational content through realistic video interactions. The goal is to create a scalable, engaging platform for digital education.

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ **v1 Initial Prototype**: Google Live API experiment (React-based real-time streaming)
- ✅ **v2 Free APIs**: Working prototype (Flask + Gemini + HeyGen async video generation)
- 📝 **Research Phase**: Week 3 - Analyzing approaches and planning next steps

## 🏗️ Implementation Approaches

### v1 - Initial Prototype (Google Live API)
**Location**: `implementations/v1-initial-prototype/`

- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Google Gemini Live API
- **Approach**: Real-time streaming conversation
- **Status**: Experimental prototype
- **Key Features**: Live audio processing, real-time responses, WebSocket communication

### v2 - Free APIs Version (Current Working Prototype)
**Location**: `implementations/v2-free-apis/`

- **Tech Stack**: Python Flask + Google Gemini + HeyGen
- **Approach**: Async video generation with custom avatars
- **Status**: Fully functional prototype
- **Key Features**: Custom avatar creation, voice input, video responses, persona customization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try v2 (Recommended - Fully Functional)
```bash
cd implementations/v2-free-apis
# Follow README.md instructions
```

### Explore v1 (Experimental)
```bash
cd implementations/v1-initial-prototype
# Follow README.md instructions
```

## 📈 Research Progress

See [`research-notes/README.md`](research-notes/README.md) for detailed weekly progress tracking.

### Key Milestones
- **Week 1**: Initial concept exploration and technology research
- **Week 2**: First implementation attempts and API integration
- **Week 3**: Comparative analysis and architecture decisions

## 🔬 Research Findings

### Architecture Comparison
- **Real-time vs Async**: Trade-offs between responsiveness and video quality
- **API Costs**: Free tier limitations vs premium features
- **User Experience**: Voice input vs text input preferences
